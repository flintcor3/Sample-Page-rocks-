    <h3>    Where Did It All Come From?</h3>
    <p>
        The Earth has been turning for 4&half; billion years! In that time there's been a continuous process of mighty mountain ranges forming, creation of new crust by spreading ridges, and it's reclamation by subducting slabs.
        By far the vast majority of modern day rocks have been melted down and reconstituted several times over. By examining them we can glean information about how various regions came to be and learn how our tiny slice of the cosmos keeps turning.

    <p>
        In the beginning the whole solar system was an accretion cloud, spiralling around a newly forming sun. Like a centerfuge, the lighter elements gravitatied towards the outer edges where they flew off or condensed into the gas giants. The heavier elements tended to be drawn in, getting stored in our star or if their velocity was sufficient forming the terrestrial planets.

        Obviously with a system spanning such a large scale things never became entirely heterogenous. Speedily moving elements further out were accreted into the larger planets, while slower ones had their orbits decay or got trapped in the gravitational pull of rocky bodies.

        The rocks formed by these processes come in three types,
        <ul>
            <li><a href="igneous.html">Igneous</a></li>
            <li><a href="metamorphic.html">Metamorphic</a></li>
            <li><a href="sedimentry.html">Sedimentary</a></li>
        </ul>
